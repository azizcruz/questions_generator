This is my assessment solution.

### To start

make sure that you have installed in your machine.

## this tutorial is only for ubuntu OS.

`node js at least v18`

`php at least v8.1`

`composer`


### then

# for backend

`cd backend`

`composer install`

`php artisan serve`

no need to migrate anything as sqlite will be used as your database for now.

# for frontend

`cd frontend`

`npm install`

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

`ng serve`

### The docker version still not 100% working because my machine is slow and could not handle it.
